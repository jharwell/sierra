                               A list of construction targets within a scenario, separated by spaces.

                               (A,B,C) are the dimensions of the bounding box for the target, and must be
                               integers. (X,Y) specifies the anchor of the target in the XY plane, defined as the
                               lower-left hand corner of the target.

                               Valid types are:

                               - ``rectprism`` - A rectangular, prismatic solid comprising a 4 sided polygonal base of
                                 dimensions AxB in X and Y, respectively, a second base which is a copy of the first,
                                 translated upward in Z by C units, and 4 other rectangular faces.

                               - ``ramp`` - A sloped ramp with slope along the X-axis from 0 to C.

                               For all structures, the active face is always on the positive X axis (for now).
                               Use=stage{1}; can be omitted otherwise.

                               Specify the primary orientation for the target, which defines the axis along which the
                               slope will be placed (for ``ramp`` structures), and the orientation of the X axis for
                               ``rectprism`` structures.
