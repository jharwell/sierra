  # 2024/08/27: We don't test the core with OSX, because if it works on linux,
  # it should work on OSX. Plus, the plugin tests utilize a lot of "core"
  # functionality, it the core is already largely tested on OSX via that
  # route. Plugins are another story, and are explicitly tested on OSX where
  # feasible.
