** TODO [#A] Create SIERRA pypi package [65%]
- [X] Push --scenario to the FORDYCA plugin--not part of core SIERRA
- [X] Push templates/scripts to the FORDYCA plugin--not part of core SIERRA
- [X] Make PopulationDensity not coupled to SS,DS,RN,PL block distribution, which it is currently.
- [X] Move convergence stuff out of exp_generator--not part of core SIERRA
- [X] Move LOG4CXX_CONFIGURATION check out of HPC--not part of core SIERRA
- [X] Make SIERRA runnable from directories other than the repo directory
- [X] Verify that all the batch criteria I moved to FORDYCA still work as expected
- [X] Move all yaml config out of SIERRA core. Should retain the ability to merge configs though, as I will need that
       for TITARRA common stuff merging with FORDYCA/PRISM specific config.
- [X] Create derived TemporalVariance  batch criteria for FORDYCA. (BC|BM|M types are specific to my project).
      This must be done AFTER creating titarra--the parser is used in vcs.py
- [X] Rename xml_luigi to something that makes more sense
- [X] Create trivial ARGoS library to use with SIERRA as a trivial example
- [X] Document all the SIERRA hooks that exist/I use in TITERRA
- [X] Update contributing guide: LIBRA development workflow so it makes sense for sierra (originally written for C++),
  and add CONTRIBUTING.md which points to this page in the docs.
- [X] Refine docs for all overridable SIERRA hooks to make them more usable to others.
- [X] Docs for what statistics SIERRA can generate
- [ ] More SAANoise out of SIERRA--to uses the perf.robustness dictionary, which I am moving out to TITERRA. ALso, SAA
     noise requires ARGoS functionality that is not in the main repo and will not probably ever make it there.
- [X] Remove --help; it should be a generic message that directs people to the online docs
- [ ] Document the plugin search path somewhere
- [ ] Remove the pm_query() stuff from ARGoS batch criteria--that is specific to my project. If I need it, I should
      derive from the necessary ARGoS batch criteria and then add that single function.
- [ ] Fix the arena_dims(), populations() being in the BatchCriteria class--ARGoS specific.
- [ ] Update all parsers to use sections to make error messages cleaner
- [X] Add tutorials for adding new platform to execution exec_env, and vice versa. Talk about how they are coupled.
- [ ] Add docs for which cmdline arguments all platforms must implement
- [ ] Setup travis for some basic integration tests with the sample project for ARGoS and ROS+Gazebo.
- [ ] Create interface classes for all plugins--will make documenting easier, as well as help users to find bugs when
      adding plugins
- [ ] Add docs for the sample project for the rosrobot plugin
- [ ] Update config tutorials with changes to rosrobot (template input file, )
** TODO [#B] Fix the pylint import error false positives
** TODO [#B] Switch reading intra experiment model dataframe index sizes
From using the size of a different dataframe in the exp to reading from the time setup written to the pkl file.

** TODO [#B] Add some example pbs/slurm scripts in the HPC docs
- [X] Re-run a batch experiment which got killed by the HPC scheduler
- [X] Do I need to re-run SIERRA to tweak graphs

** TODO [#B] Switch all collated .csvs to have .mean extension to make things consistent
Stat csv extension mapping should probably be put in the config module
** TODO [#B] For all bivar perf measures, add scatter plot generation
Might be helpful to spot trends among different controllers. Would also need to be implemented in stage 5 as another
comparison option.

** TODO [#B] Remove **kwargs usage from graphs--explicit arguments leads to way better type checking
** TODO [#B] Setup travis CI with mypy+pytype
** TODO [#B] Rename perf measure config from 'perf' to 'stage1/stage3/stage4/etc'.
Much clearer this way. Also fits better with the 'stage5.yaml' config file idea.


** TODO [#C] Check out the fastcore library
** TODO [#C] Try Modin as a parallel pandas wrapper

** DONE [#C] Create SIERRA design philosophy
   CLOSED: [2021-10-30 Sat 11:51]
- Never deletes directories for you, only overwrites stage 1 if you tell it to.
- Pipeline design
- Everything is configurable
- Fail early and often

** DONE [#A] Create TITERRA
   CLOSED: [2021-05-21 Fri 10:46]
- [X] Create derived PopulationSize batch criteria for FORDYCA. The one in SIERRA core sets a population_dynamics tag.
- [X] Add --scenario generator
- [X] Add scripts/, templates/ from SIERRA

** DONE [#C] Make all my colors colorblind safe (should be a set of matplotlib colors I can select for this).
   CLOSED: [2021-07-19 Mon 15:03]
** DONE [#A] Create tutorial section for SIERRA [100%]
   CLOSED: [2021-10-23 Sat 18:46]
- [X] Define a new variable
- [X] Define a new project (needs updating)
- [X] Render video with ARGoS and from .csvs (this needs updating and clarification on directory roots/where things go/come from)
- [X] Controller comparison/stage5
- [X] Project rendering
- [X] Create docs specifying that SIERRA is for homogeneous swarms mainly.
- [X] Add rendering example

** DONE [#B] Updates docs for the config (stage5, main)
   CLOSED: [2021-10-26 Tue 08:38]
** DONE [#B] Update FORDYCA models with the new perf measures definitions
   CLOSED: [2021-10-30 Sat 11:52]
