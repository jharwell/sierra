Getting Started With SIERRA
===========================

If you're looking for the "I just want to try out SIERRA without doing any work"
quickstart, see :ref:`ln-sierra-trial`. Otherwise, the steps to install SIERRA and
setup the interface between your python/C++ project and SIERRA are below.

Installing SIERRA
=================

#. From the SIERRA repo root, install SIERRA locally by following
   :ref:`ln-sierra-packages`.


#. Install OS packages (if you don't see your OS below you will have to find and
   install the equivalent packages).

   .. tabs::

         .. group-tab:: Ubuntu

            Install the following with ``apt install``:

            - ``parallel``
            - ``cm-super``
            - ``texlive-fonts-recommended``
            - ``texlive-latex-extra``
            - ``dvipng``
            - ``pssh``
            - ``ffmpeg``
            - ``xvfb``

         .. group-tab:: OSX

            Install the following with ``brew install``:

            - ``parallel``
            - ``--cask mactex``
            - ``pssh``


   If you are on a different Linux distribution you will have to find and
   install the equivalent packages.

   .. IMPORTANT:: SIERRA will not work correctly in all cases if these packages
                  (or their equivalent) are not installed! It may start, it
                  might even not crash immediately depending on what you are
                  using it to do.

General Setup Workflow
======================

#. Browse through the SIERRA :doc:`/src/glossary` to get an overview of the
   terminology that SIERRA uses in the code and in the documentation--a little
   of this will go a long way towards quickly understanding how to get started
   and use SIERRA!

#. Select which :term:`Platform` SIERRA should target. See
   :ref:`ln-sierra-platform-plugins` for supported platforms. If your desired platform
   is not in the list, never fear! It's easy to create a new platform plugin,
   see :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-plugin-platform`.

#. Look at :ref:`ln-sierra-req-exp` to see how to organize your experimental
   inputs/template input files so they can be used with SIERRA, and if you need
   to modify the way your code outputs data so that SIERRA can process it.

#. Setup the interface between your code and SIERRA by defining a SIERRA
   :term:`Project` in python by following :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-project`.

#. Select an execution environment for SIERRA that matches your available
   computational resources: :ref:`ln-sierra-exec-env-hpc` or :ref:`ln-sierra-exec-env-robots`,
   following the appropriate setup guide. If there is nothing suitable, never
   fear! It's easy to create a new execution environment plugin, see
   :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-plugin-exec-env`.

#. Decide what variable you are interested in investigating by consulting the
   :term:`Batch Criteria` available for your project (i.e., what variable(s) you
   want to change across some range and see how system behavior changes, or
   doesn't change). Which criteria are available to use depends on your
   :term:`Platform`; if you don't see something suitable, you can
   :ref:`Define A New Batch Criteria <ln-sierra-tutorials-project-new-bc>`.

#. Look at the :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-cli` to understand how to invoke SIERRA in
   general.

#. Look at the :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-examples` to get ideas on how to craft your own
   SIERRA invocation. If you get stuck, look at :ref:`ln-sierra-faq` for answers to
   common questions.

#. Determine how to invoke SIERRA. At a minimum you need to tell it the
   following:

   - What platform you are targeting/want to run on: ``--platform``. See
     :ref:`ln-sierra-platform-plugins` for details.

   - What project to load: ``--project``. This is used to:

     - Configure runtime search paths (e.g.,
       :envvar:`ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH`, :envvar:`ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`).

     - Figure out the directory to load graph and :term:`Experiment` data
       processing configuration from.

   - What template input file to use: ``--template-input-file``. See
     :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-template-input-file` for requirements.

   - How many variations of the main settings for each experiment to run:
     ``--n-runs``.

   - Where it is running/how to run experiments: ``--exec-env``. See
     :ref:`ln-sierra-exec-env-hpc` for available plugins.

   - What controller to run: ``--controller``. See
     :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-main-config` for details on how valid
     controllers are defined for a :term:`Project`. :term:`Project` dependent.

   - How large the arena should be, what block distribution type to use (for
     example), etc. ``--scenario``. :term:`Project` dependent.

   - What you are investigating; that is, what variable are you interested in
     varying: ``--batch-criteria``.

   If you try to invoke SIERRA with an (obviously) incorrect combination of
   command line options, it will refuse to do anything. For less obviously
   incorrect combinations, it will (hopefully) stop when an assert fails before
   doing anything substantial.

   Full documentation of all command line options it accepts is in
   :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-cli`, and there are many useful options that SIERRA accepts,
   so skimming the CLI docs is **very** worthwhile.

   .. IMPORTANT:: Generally speaking, do not try to run SIERRA on HPC
                  environments with a debug build of whatever project you are
                  using (:xref:`FORDYCA`, :xref:`PRISM`, etc). It will work but
                  be obnoxiously/irritatingly slow. SIERRA is intended for
                  `production` code (well, as close to production as research
                  code gets) which is compiled with optimizations enabled.

#. Setup the cmdline environment you are going to invoke SIERRA in.

   - Set :envvar:`SIERRA_PLUGIN_PATH` appropriately.

   Different platforms may require additional environments to be set.

#. Learn SIERRA's runtime :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-runtime-exp-tree`. When running, SIERRA
   will create a (rather) large directory structure for you, so reading the docs
   is worthwhile to understand what the structure means, and to gain intuition
   into where to look for the inputs/outputs of different stages, etc., without
   having to search exhaustively through the filesystem.

#. Invoke SIERRA! Again, look at the :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-examples` for some ideas.
