How To Use SIERRA
=================

This page contains more in-depth documentation on how to use SIERRA/required
configuration beyond the minimum needed to get started, and assumes that you
have either gotten SIERRA working via :ref:`ln-trial` or
:ref:`ln-getting-started`. Once you've done that, the docs on this page provide
a good way to understand how to get the most out of SIERRA.
