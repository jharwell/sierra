SIERRA Runtime Directory Tree
=============================

.. IMPORTANT:: SIERRA **NEVER** deletes directories for you.

   Subsequent experiments using the same values for the following cmdline
   arguments **WILL** result in the same calculated root directory for
   experimental inputs and outputs, even if other parameters change (or if you
   change the contents of the template input file):

   - ``--controller``
   - ``--scenario``
   - ``--sierra-root``
   - ``--template-input-file``
   - ``--batch-criteria``

   SIERRA will abort stage {1,2} processing when this occurs in order to
   preserve data integrity; this behavior can be overwridden with
   ``--exp-overwrite``, in which case the use assumes full responsibility for
   ensuring the integrity of the experiment.

   Always better to check the arguments before hitting ENTER. Measure twice, cut
   once, as the saying goes.

Default Pipeline Directory Tree (Stages 1-4)
--------------------------------------------

When SIERRA runs stages 1-4, it creates a directory structure under whatever was
passed as ``--sierra-root``. For the purposes of explanation, I will use the
following partial SIERRA option set to explain the experiment tree::

  --sierra-root=$HOME/exp\
  --controller=CATEGORY.my_controller\
  --scenario=SS.12x6\
  --platform=platform.argos\
  --batch-criteria=population_size.Log8\
  --n-runs=4\
  --template-input-file=~/my-template.argos\
  --project=fordyca


This invocation will cause SIERRA to create the following directory structure as
it runs:

- ``$HOME/exp`` - This is the root of the directory structure (``--sierra-root``),
  and is **NOT** deleted on subsequent runs.

  - ``fordyca`` - Each project gets their own directory, so you can disambiguate
    otherwise identical SIERRA invocations and don't overwrite the directories
    for a previously used project on subsequent runs.

    - ``CATEGORY.my_controller`` - Each controller gets their own directory in the
      project root, which is **NOT** deleted on subsequent runs.

      - ``mytemplate-SS.12x6`` - The directory for the :term:`Batch Experiment`
        is named from a combination of the template input file used
        (``--template-input-file``) and the scenario (``--scenario``).

        - ``exp-inputs`` - Root directory for :term:`Experimental<Experiment>`
          inputs; each experiment in the batch gets their own directory in here.

          - ``exp0`` - Within the input directory for each experiment in the
            batch (there are 4 such directories in this example), there will be
            an input file for each :term:`Experimental Run` in the experiment,
            as well as a ``commands.txt`` used by GNU parallel to run them all
            in parallel. The leaf of the ``--template-input-file``, sans
            extension, has the experimental run # appended to it
            (e.g. ``my-template_0.argos`` is the input file for simulation 0).

              - ``commands.txt``
              - ``my-template_0.argos``
              - ``my-template_1.argos``
              - ``my-template_2.argos``
              - ``my-template_3.argos``

          - ``exp1``

            - ``my-template_0.argos``
            - ``my-template_1.argos``
            - ``my-template_2.argos``
            - ``my-template_3.argos``

          - ``exp2``

            - ``...``

        - ``exp-outputs`` - Root directory for experimental outputs; each
          experiment gets their own directory in here (just like for experiment
          inputs). Directory name is controlled by the main YAML configuration.

          - ``exp0`` - Within the output directory for each experiment in the
            batch (there are 3 such directories in this example), there will be
            a `directory` (rather than a file, as was the case for inputs) for
            each experimental run's output, including metrics, grabbed frames,
            etc., as configured in the XML input file.

            - ``my-template_0_output``
            - ``my-template_1_output``
            - ``my-template_2_output``
            - ``my-template_3_output``

          - ``exp1``

            - ``my-template_0_output``
            - ``my-template_1_output``
            - ``my-template_2_output``
            - ``my-template_3_output``

          - ``exp2``

            - ``...``


          - ``statistics`` - Root directory for holding statistics calculated
            during stage3 for use during stage4.

            - ``exp0`` - Contains the results of statistics generation for exp0
              (mean, stddev, etc., as configured).

            - ``exp1``

            - ``exp2``

            - ``...``

            - ``collated`` - Contains :term:`Collated .csv` files. During
              stage4, SIERRA will draw specific columns from .csv files under
              ``statistics`` according to configuration, and collate them under
              here for graph generation of `inter`\-experiment graphs.

            - ``exec`` - Statistics about SIERRA runtime. Useful for capturing
              runtime of specific experiments to better plan/schedule time on
              HPC clusters.

        - ``imagize`` - Root directory for holding imagized files (averaged run
          outputs which have been converted to graphs) which can be patched
          together in stage 4 to generated videos. Each experiment will get its
          own directory under here, with unique sub-directories for each
          different type of :term:`Experimental Run` data captured for
          imagizing. See :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-rendering-project` for more details.

        - ``videos`` - Root directory for holding rendered videos generated
          during stage 4 from either captured simulator frames for imagized
          project files. Each experiment will get its own directory under here,
          with See :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-vc` for more details.

        - ``models`` - During stage4, the dataframes generated by all executed
          models are stored under this directory. Each experiment in the batch
          gets their own directory for `intra`\-experiment models.

        - ``graphs`` - During stage4, all generated graphs are output under this
          directory. Each experiment in the batch gets their own directory for
          `intra`\-experiment graphs.

          - ``exp0``
          - ``exp1``
          - ``exp2``
          - ``exp3``
          - ``collated`` - Graphs which are generated across experiments in the
            batch from collated .csv data, rather than from the averaged results
            within each experiment, are output here.

Stage 5 Directory Tree
----------------------

When SIERRA runs stage 5, stages 1-4 must have already been successfully run,
and therefore the directory tree shown above will exist. For the purposes of
explanation, I will use the following partial SIERRA option sets to explain the
additions to the experiment tree for stage 5.

First, the experiment tree for `scenario comparison`::

   --pipeline 5\
   --scenario-comparison\
   --batch-criteria population_size.Log8\
   --scenarios-list=RN.16x16x2,PL.16x16x2\
   --sierra-root=$HOME/exp"


This invocation will cause SIERRA to create the following directory structure as
it runs:

- ``$HOME/exp``

  - ``RN.16x16x2+PL.16x16x2-sc-graphs``

    This is the directory holding the comparison graphs for all controllers
    which were previously run on the scenarios ``RN.16x16x2`` and ``PL.16x16x2``
    (scenario names are arbitrary for the purposes of stage 5 and entirely
    depend on the project). Inside this directory will be all graphs generated
    according to the configuration specified in
    :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-stage5-config`.

Second, the experiment tree for `controller comparison` ::

  --pipeline 5\
  --controller-comparison\
  --batch-criteria population_size.Log8\
  --controllers-list d0.CRW,d0.DPO\
  --sierra-root=$HOME/exp"


This invocation will cause SIERRA to create the following directory structure as
it runs:

- ``$HOME/exp``

  - ``d0.CRW+d0.DPO-cc-graphs``

    This is the directory holding the comparison graphs for each scenario for
    which ``d0.CRW`` and ``d0.DPO`` were run (scenarios are computed by
    examining the directory tree for stages 1-4). Controller names are arbitrary
    for the purposes of stage 5 and entirely depend on the project). Inside this
    directory will be all graphs generated according to the configuration
    specified in :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-stage5-config`.
