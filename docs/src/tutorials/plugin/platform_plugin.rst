Creating a New Platform Plugin
==============================

For the purposes of this tutorial, I will assume you are creating a new
:term:`Platform` :term:`Plugin` ``matrix``, and the code for that plugin lives
in ``$HOME/git/plugins/platform/matrix``.

If you are creating a new platform, you have two options.

#. Create a stand-alone platform, providing your own definitions for all of the
   necessary functions/classes below.

#. Derive from an existing platform by simply calling the "parent" platform's
   functions/calling in your derived definitions except when you need to
   actually extend them (e.g., to add support for a new HPC plugin)

In either case, the steps to actually create the code are below.

Create the Code
===============

Create the following filesystem structure and content in
``$HOME/git/plugins/platform/matrix``. Each file is required; any number of
additional files can be included.


#. ``plugin.py``

   Within this file, you must define the following classes:
