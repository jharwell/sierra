Configuration for robot controllers.

Root level dictionaries: varies; project dependent. Each root level
dictionary is treated as the name of a :term:`Controller Category` when
``--controller`` is parsed. For example, if you pass
``--controller=mycategory.FizzBuzz`` to SIERRA, then you need to have a
root level dictionary ``mycategory`` defined in ``controllers.yaml``.

A complete YAML configuration for a :term:`Controller Category`
``mycategory`` and a controller ``FizzBuzz`` is shown below, separated by
platform. This configuration specifies that all graphs in the categories
of ``LN_MyCategory1``, ``LN_MyCategory2``, ``HM_MyCategory1``,
``HM_MyCategory2`` are applicable to ``FizzBuzz``, and should be generated
if the necessary :term:`Experiment` output files exist. The
``LN_MyCategory1``, ``LN_MyCategory2`` graph categories are common to
multiple controllers in this project, while the ``HM_MyCategory1``,
``HM_MyCategory2`` :term:`graph categories<Graph Category>` are specific
to the ``FizzBuzz`` controller.
