SIERRA Hooks
============

SIERRA allows a number of different elements of its pipeline to be customized
and extend by a :term:`Project`. To override part of a stage of the SIERRA
pipeline, you must create a ``pipeline/stageX`` directory structure in your
project directory, where ``stageX`` is the stage you want to override part of.

.. NOTE:: This is the most advanced feature of SIERRA, and strange things may
          happen or things might not work right if you don't call the
          ``super()`` version of whatever functions you are overriding in your
          hook.

.. WARNING:: Don't try to override parts of the pipeline which are not listed
             below. It will probably not work, and even if it does there is
             every chance that it will break stuff.

Multi-Stage Hooks
=================

Base Batch Criteria
-------------------

Suppose you want to extend one of the following core SIERRA classes to add
additional attributes/methods you want to be accessible to all :term:`Batch
Criteria` in your project:

- :class:`~sierra.core.variables.batch_criteria.BatchCriteria`

- :class:`~sierra.core.variables.batch_criteria.UnivarBatchCriteria`

- :class:`~sierra.core.variables.batch_criteria.BivarBatchCriteria`

To do this, do following:

#. Create ``variables/batch_criteria.py`` in the root directory for your
   project.

#. Override one or more of the classes above, and SIERRA will then select your
   version of said override classes when running. Exactly where SIERRA is
   looking/what module it uses when a given class is requested can be seen with
   ``--log-level=TRACE``.

.. WARNING:: Don't override or extend any of the interfaces! It will causes
             static analysis and/or runtime errors.

Stage 3 Hooks
=============

Experimental Run Collation
--------------------------

In order to generate additional inter-experiment graphs, you have to also
collate additional CSV files by:

#. Create ``pipeline/stage3/run_collator.py``.

#. Override the
   :class:`sierra.core.pipeline.stage3.run_collator.ExperimentalRunCSVGatherer`
   class:

   .. code-block:: python

      import sierra.core.pipeline.stage3.run_collator as run_collator

      class ExperimentalRunCSVGatherer(run_collator.ExperimentalRunCSVGatherer):
          def gather_csvs_from_run(self,
                                   exp_output_root: str,
                                   run: str) -> tp.Dict[tp.Tuple[str, str], pd.DataFrame]:
              ...


Stage 4 Hooks
=============

Tiered YAML Config
------------------

Suppose you have some graphs which are common to multiple SIERRA projects, and
you don't want to have to duplicate the graph definitions in the ``.yaml``
files. You can put those definitions in a single location and then add them to
the ``.yaml`` graph definitions that are unique to the :term:`Project` as
follows:

#. Create ``pipeline/stage4/yaml_config_loader.py``.

#. Override the
   :class:`sierra.core.pipeline.stage4.yaml_config_loader.YAMLConfigLoader` class:

   .. code-block:: python

      import sierra.core.pipeline.stage4.yaml_config_loader as ycl

      class YAMLConfigLoader(ycl.YAMLConfigLoader):
          def __call__(self, cmdopts: types.Cmdopts) -> tp.Dict[str, tp.Dict[str, str]]:
              ...

Intra-Experiment Graph Generation
---------------------------------

You way want to extend the set of graphs which is generated for each experiment
in the batch, based on what batch criteria is selected, or for some other
reason. To do so:

#. Create ``pipeline/stage4/intra_exp_graph_generator.py``.

#. Override the
   :class:`sierra.core.pipeline.stage4.inter_exp_graph_generator.InterExpGraphGenerator`
   class:

   .. code-block:: python

      import sierra.core.pipeline.stage4 as stage4

      class IntraExpGraphGenerator(stage4.intra_exp_graph_generator.IntraExpGraphGenerator):
          def __call__(self, criteria: bc.IConcreteBatchCriteria) -> None:
              ...

Inter-Experiment Graph Generation
---------------------------------

You way want to extend the set of graphs which is generated across each each experiment
in the batch (e.g., to create graphs of summary performance measures). To do so:

#. Create ``pipeline/stage4/Inter_exp_graph_generator.py``.

#. Override the
   :class:`sierra.core.pipeline.stage4.inter_exp_graph_generator.InterExpGraphGenerator`
   class:

   .. code-block:: python

      import sierra.core.pipeline.stage4 as stage4
      import sierra.core.batch_criteria as bc

      class InterExpGraphGenerator(stage4.inter_exp_graph_generator.InterExpGraphGenerator):
          def __call__(self, criteria: bc.IConcreteBatchCriteria) -> None:
              ...
