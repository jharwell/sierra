Graph Configuration
===================

This page has the following sections:

- How to create a new :term:`Graph Category`

- How to define a new graph within a :term:`Graph Category` to generate from
  :term:`Experimental Run` outputs.

- How to "activate" the new graph so that it will be generated from experimental
  run outputs where applicable.

- How to generate additional graphs during stage 4 beyond those possible with
  the SIERRA core.

Create A New Graph Category
===========================

Add a root level dictionary to one of the following YAML configuration files:

- ``<project>/config/intra-graphs-line.yaml`` for intra-experiment line
  graphs. Dictionaries must start with ``LN_``.

- ``<project>/config/intra-graphs-hm.yaml`` for intra-experiment
  heatmaps. Dictionaries must start with ``HM_``.

- ``<project>/config/inter-graphs-line.yaml`` for inter-experiment line
  graphs. Dictionaries must start with ``LN_``.

An example ``intra-graphs-line.yaml``, defining two categories of linegraphs:

.. code-block:: YAML

   graphs:
     LN_mycategory1:
       - ...
       - ...
       - ...

     LN_mycategory2:
       - ...
       - ...
       - ...

``intra-graphs-hm.yaml`` and ``inter-graphs-line.yaml`` have identical
structures.

.. IMPORTANT:: The ``graphs`` dictionary `must` be at the root of all ``.yaml``
               files containing graph configuration.


.. IMPORTANT:: Because SIERRA tells matplotlib to use LaTeX internally to
               generate graph labels, titles, etc., the standard LaTeX character
               restrictions within strings apply to all fields (e.g., '#' is
               illegal but '\#' is OK).


Add A New Intra-Experiment Graph To An Existing Category
========================================================

There are two types of intra-experiment graphs: linegraphs and heatmaps, and
each has their own config file (details of each is below).

Linegraphs
----------

Linegraphs are appropriate if:

- The data you want to graph can be represented by a line (i.e. is one
  dimensional in some way).

- The data you want to graph can be obtained from a single .csv file (multiple
  columns in the same CSV file can be graphed simultaneously).

``LN_XXX`` YAML Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless stated otherwise, all keys are mandatory.

.. code-block:: YAML

   LN_mycategory:
     # The filename (no path) of the CSV within the experimental run output
     # directory for an experimental run, sans the CSV extension.
     - src_stem: 'foo'

     # The filename (no path) of the graph to be generated
     # (extension/image type is determined elsewhere). This allows for multiple
     # graphs to be generated from the same CSV file by plotting different
     # combinations of columns.
     - dest_stem: 'bar'

     # List of names of columns within the source CSV that should be
     # included on the plot. Must match EXACTLY (i.e. no fuzzy matching). Can be
     # omitted to plot all columns within the CSV.
     - cols:
         - 'col1'
         - 'col2'
         - 'col3'
         - '...'

     # The title the graph should have. LaTeX syntax is supported (uses
     # matplotlib after all). Optional.
     - title: 'My Title'

     # List of names of the plotted lines within the graph. Can be
     # omitted to set the legend for each column to the name of the column
     # in the CSV.
     - legend:
         - 'Column 1'
         - 'Column 2'
         - 'Column 3'
         - '...'

     # The label of the X-axis of the graph. Optional.
     - xlabel: 'X'

     # The label of the Y-axis of the graph. Optional.
     - ylabel: 'Y'

Heatmaps
--------

Heatmaps are appropriate if:

- The data you want to graph is two dimensional (e.g. a spatial representation
  of the arena is some way).

``HM_XXX`` YAML Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless stated otherwise, all keys are mandatory.

.. code-block:: YAML

   graphs:
     # The filename (no path) of the CSV within the output directory
     # for an experimental run to look for the column(s) to plot, sans the CSV
     # extension.
     - src_stem: 'fooCSV'

     # The title the graph should have. LaTeX syntax is supported (uses
     # matplotlib after all). Optional.
     - title: 'My Title'

How to Add A New Inter-Experiment Graph
=======================================

Linegraphs
----------

Inter-experiment linegraphs are appropriate if:

- The data you want to graph can be represented by a line (i.e. is one
  dimensional in some way).

- The data you want to graph can be obtained from a single column from a single
  CSV file.

- The data you want to graph requires comparison between multiple experiments in
  a batch.

``LN_XXX`` YAML Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See same as intra-experiment linegraphs, EXCEPT:

Each inter-experiment linegraph has an additional optional boolean field
``summary`` which determines if the generated graph is a
:class:`~sierra.core.graphs.summary_line_graph.SummaryLineGraph` or a
:class:`~sierra.core.graphs.stacked_line_graph.StackedLineGraph` (default if
omitted).


How to Activate New Graph Category
==================================

If you added a new :term:`Graph Category`, it will not automatically be used to
generate graphs for existing or new controllers. You will need to modify the
``<project>/config/controllers.yaml`` file to specify which controllers your new
category of graphs should be generated for. See
:ref:`ln-sierra-tutorial-project-main-config` for details.


How to Generate Additional Graphs
=================================

This can be done by extending
:class:`~sierra.core.pipeline.stage4.inter_exp_graph_generator.InterExpGraphGenerator`. Create
``<project>/pipeline/stage4/inter_exp_graph_generator.py`` and define a
``InterExpGraphGenerator`` class which inherits from
:class:`~sierra.core.pipeline.stage4.inter_exp_graph_generator.InterExpGraphGenerator`. It's
constructor must be::

  def __init__(self,
               main_config: types.ParsedYAMLDict,
               cmdopts: types.Cmdopts,
               targets: tp.List[types.ParsedYAMLDict]) -> None:

And it must define::

  def __call__(self, criteria: bc.IConcreteBatchCriteria) -> None:


SIERRA will then use this class when generating graphs during stage 4. You
probably should have ``super().__call__(criteria)`` in the ``__call__()`` you
define, but you don't have to.
