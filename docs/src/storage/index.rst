formats. Supported formats that come with SIERRA are:

CSV
===

This storage plugin can be selected via ``--storage-medium=storage.csv``.

This is the default storage type which SIERRA will use to read
:term:`Experimental Run` outputs.

.. IMPORTANT:: The CSV files read by this plugin must be semicolon (``;``)
               delimited, `NOT` comma delimited; this may changed in a future
               version of SIERRA.
