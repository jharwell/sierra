SIERRA Support Matrix
=====================

SIERRA supports multiple :term:`Platforms <Platform>` which researchers can
write code to target, as shown below.  If your desired platform is not listed,
see the :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials` for how to add it via a plugin.

.. IMPORTANT:: In SIERRA terminology, platform != OS. If a SIERRA platform runs
               on a given OS, then SIERRA supports doing so; if it does not,
               then SIERRA does not. For example, SIERRA does not support
               running ARGoS on windows, because ARGoS does not support windows.

   * - Platform

     - Description

   * - `ARGoS <https://www.argos-sim.info/index.php>`_

     - Simulator for fast simulation of large swarms. Requires ARGoS >=
       3.0.0-beta59.

   * - `ROS1 <https://ros.org)+[Gazebo](https://www.gazebosim.org>`_

     - Using ROS1 with the Gazebo simulator. Requires Gazebo >= 11.9.0, ROS1
       Noetic or later.

   * - `ROS1+Robot <https://ros.org>`_

     - Using ROS1 with a real robot platform of your choice. ROS1 Noetic or
       later is required.

SIERRA supports multiple HPC environments for execution of experiments in on HPC
hardware (see :doc:`/src/exec_env/hpc`) and on real robots (see
:doc:`/src/exec_env/robot`). If your desired execution environment is not
listed, see the :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials` for how to add it via a plugin.

.. list-table::

   :widths: 50,50

   * - Execution Environment

     - Description

   * - `SLURM <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_

     - An HPC cluster managed by the SLURM scheduler

   * - `Torque/MOAB <https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager>`_

     - An HPC cluster managed by the Torque/MOAB scheduler

   * - Adhoc

     - Miscellaneous collection of networked HPC compute nodes or random
       servers; not managed by a scheduler

   * - HPC local

     - The SIERRA host machine,e.g., a researcher's laptop

   * - `Turtlebot3 <https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview>`_

     - Real turtlebot3 robots

   * - Platform

     - Description

   * - `ARGoS <https://www.argos-sim.info/index.php>`_

     - Simulator for fast simulation of large swarms. Requires ARGoS >=
       3.0.0-beta59.

   * - `ROS1 <https://ros.org)+[Gazebo](https://www.gazebosim.org>`_

     - Using ROS1 with the Gazebo simulator. Requires Gazebo >= 11.9.0, ROS1
       Kinetic or later.

   * - `ROS1+Robot <https://ros.org>`_

     - Using ROS1 with a real robot platform of your choice. ROS1 Kinetic or
       later is required.

SIERRA also supports multiple output formats for experimental outputs. If the
format for your experimental outputs is not listed, see the `docs
<https://sierra.readthedocs.io/en/master/src/tutorials.html>`_
for how to add it via a plugin. SIERRA currently only supports XML experimental
inputs.

   * - Experimental Output Format

     - Scope

   * - CSV file

     - Raw experimental outputs, transforming into heatmap images

   * - PNG file

     - Stitching images together into videos

SIERRA supports (mostly) mix-and-match between platforms, execution
environments, experiment input/output formats as shown in its support matrix
below. This is one of the most powerful features of SIERRA!
