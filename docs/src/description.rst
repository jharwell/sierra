SIERRA is a command line tool and plugin framework for:

- Automating scientific research, providing faculties for seamless experiment
  generation, execution, and results processing.

- Accelerating research cycles by allowing researchers to focus on the “science”
  aspects: developing new things and designing experiments to test them.

- Improving the reproducibility of scientific research, particular in AI.

It supports a wide range of platforms, execution environments, and experiment
input/output formats--see :ref:`ln-sierra-support-matrix` for details.  A short
overview of the research automation SIERRA provides is here:
:ref:`ln-sierra-usage-pipeline`. To get started, see
:ref:`ln-sierra-getting-started`.
