====================
ROS1+Gazebo Platform
====================

This platform can be selected via ``--platform=platform.ros1gazebo``.

This is the platform on which SIERRA will run experiments using the
:term:`Gazebo` simulator and :term:`ROS1`. It cannot be used to run
experiments on real robots. To use this platform, you must setup the
:ref:`SIERRA ROSBridge <ln-sierra-packages-rosbridge>`.

Worlds within ROS1+Gazebo are infinite from the perspective of physics engines,
even though a finite area shows up in rendering. So, to place robots randomly in
the arena at the start of simulation across :term:`Experimental Runs
<Experimental Run>` (if you want to do that) "dimensions" for a given world must
be specified as part of the ``--scenario`` argument. If you don't specify
dimensions as part of the ``--scenario`` argument, then you need to supply a
list of valid robot positions via ``--robot-positions`` which SIERRA will choose
from randomly for each robot.

Random Seeding For Reproducibility
==================================

ROS1+Gazebo do not provide a random number generator manager, but SIERRA
provides random seeds to each :term:`Experimental Run` which :term:`Project`
code should use to manage random number generation, if needed, to maximize
reproducability. See :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-template-input-file` and
:ref:`ln-sierra-req-exp` for details on the format of the provided seed. By default
SIERRA does not overwrite its generated random seeds for each experiment once
generated; you can override with ``--no-preserve-seeds``.
