SIERRA Glossary
===============

SIERRA uses a number of common research-related terms, perhaps in different ways
than you are used to. They are defined here to help demystify `why` SIERRA
works/is designed the way it is, and to help you find your way around.

.. glossary::

   Project

      The SIERRA plugin allowing you to use your compiled C++ library+ARGoS
      within the SIERRA framework. A project is mainly a set of ``.yaml``
      configuration files, project-specific :term:`Batch Criteria`, and some
      utility classes which allow SIERRA to translate the ``--scenario``
      argument passed on the cmdline to sets of XML changes as part of
      :term:`Experiment` definition.

      .. IMPORTANT:: The parent directories of all SIERRA project plugins must be
                     on :envvar:`SIERRA_PROJECT_PATH`, or SIERRA won't be able
                     to find them.

      Specified via ``--project`` on the cmdline. See :ref:`ln-usage-cli` for
      documentation.

   Batch Criteria

      A `variable` you wish to used SIERRA to evaluate the effect of on swarm
      behavior. A batch criteria can has a single axis (such as
      :ref:`ln-bc-population-size`), in which case it is called `univariate`, or
      have two axes (such as :ref:`ln-bc-population-size` and
      :ref:`ln-bc-saa-noise`), in which case it is called `bivariate`.

      Univariate batch criteria have one dimension, and so the graphs produced
      by them are (usually) linegraphs with a numerical representation of the
      range for the variable on the X axis, and some other quantity of interest
      on the Y.

      Bivariate batch criteria have two dimensions, and so the graphs produced
      by the are (usually) heatmaps with the first variable in the criteria on
      the X axis, the second on the Y, and the quantity of interest on
      the Z. Bivariate batch criteria are always built using univariate batch
      criteria as building blocks.

      The the axis/axes you select as part of the batch criteria you will use to
      define for :term:`Batch Experiment` define the `search space` for your
      experiment: either a 1D or 2D array of :term:`Experiments<Experiment>`.

      Batch criteria define a `range` of sets changes for one or more elements
      in a template ``.argos`` file (passed to SIERRA with
      `--template-input-file`). For each element in the range, the changes are
      applied to the template ``.argos`` file to define
      :term:`Experiments<Experiment>`. The set of defined experiments is called
      a :term:`Batch Experiment`.

      See :ref:`ln-batch-criteria` for some types of batch criteria you can use.

   Batch Experiment

      A set of :term:`Experiments<Experiment>` each defined by XML changes
      generated by the selected :term:`Batch Criteria` to a template ``.argos``
      file passed to SIERRA during stage 1 via ``--template-input-file``.

      For example, for the :ref:`ln-bc-population-size` batch criteria, each
      experiment is defined by a single XML change to the provided `.argos`
      file: the number of robots in the swarm. Depending on the specifics you
      set for the `range` of sizes you are interested in, several experiments
      will be generated from the template ``.argos`` file, each differing from
      the template in the configured swarm size.

   Experiment

      A single datapoint within a :term:`Batch Experiment`;
      that is a single value of the `thing` that you are interested in varying
      across some range of experiments to see what happens (or doesn't happen).

   Simulation

      An ARGoS simulation that runs as part of an experiment. The number of
      simulations which will be run by SIERRA in stage 2 and averaged together
      by SIERRA in stage 3 is controlled by ``--n-sims``.

      All simulations in within an :term:`Experiment` are identical, with the
      exception of:

      - Different values for the XML changes resulting from the different
        experiments they are part of, as defined by the batch criteria
        generating the batch experiment.

      - Different random seeds

      - Different output directories for metrics

   Output .csv

      A ``.csv`` file generated as an output from a single
      :term:`Simulation`. It will (probably) contain a set of columns of
      simulations outputs of interest, with rows corresponding to values
      captured at different simulation times.

   Collated .csv

      A ``.csv`` file created by SIERRA during stage 4 (if inter-experiment
      graph generation is to be run). Collated ``.csv`` files contain a set
      columns, one per :term:`Experiment` in the :term:`Batch Experiment`. Each
      column is the captured value of a `single` column within an :term:`Output
      .csv`. This is to capture a specific aspect of the behavior of the swarm
      within a batch experiment, for use in graph generation.

   Summary .csv

      A ``.csv`` file created by SIERRA during stage 4 (if inter-experiment
      graph generation is to be run). A summary ``.csv`` file created from a
      ``Collated .csv`` file by taking the last row; this usually corresponds to
      steady-state behavior, which is what you are after. However, you can
      capture transient behaviors by created collated and summary ``.csv`` files
      from captured simulation outputs over short stretches of simulation
      time--SIERRA does not know the difference.

   Graph Category

      A semantric label attached to a set of graphs which are similar. For
      example, if you want to generate graphs about the different ways that
      robots allocate tasks, I might creat a ``LN_task_alloc`` label, so that
      you can enable/disable all task allocation related graphs for one or more
      controllers easily when :doc:`configuring
      </src/tutorials/project/graphs_config>` your project.

   Model

      A python implementation of a theoretical model of some kind. Can use
      empirical data from simulations, or not, as needed. Intended to generate
      predictions of `something` which can then be plotted against empirical
      results for comparison.
