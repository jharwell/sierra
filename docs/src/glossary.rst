SIERRA uses a number of common research-related terms, perhaps in different ways
than you are used to. They are defined here to help demystify `why` SIERRA
works/is designed the way it is, and to help you find your way around.

.. glossary::

   ARGoS

      A state-of-the-art multi-physics engine robotics simulator which SIERRA
      supports as a :term:`Platform`. The ARGoS website is at
      `https://www.argos-sim.info/index.php <https://www.argos-sim.info/index.php>`_.


   Gazebo

      A state-of-the-art robotics simulator with many features including .urdf
      robot models, realistic 3D rendering, and more. The Gazebo website is at
      `https://gazebosim.org <https://gazebosim.org>`_.

   ROS1

      You know it. You either love it or hate it, but you can't escape it. The
      ROS website is at `https://wiki.ros.org <https://wiki.ros.org>`_.


   ROS1+Gazebo

      A :term:`Platform` supported by SIERRA to use :term:`ROS1` with the
      :term:`Gazebo` simulator.

   ROS1+Robot

      A :term:`Platform` supported by SIERRA using :term:`ROS1` and any robot
      which supports ROS.

   Project

      The SIERRA plugin allowing you to use your code on the platform of your
      choice within the SIERRA framework. A project is mainly a set of ``.yaml``
      configuration files, project-specific :term:`Batch Criteria`, and some
      utility classes which allow SIERRA to translate the ``--scenario``
      argument passed on the cmdline to sets of XML changes as part of
      :term:`Experiment` definition.

      .. IMPORTANT:: The parent directories of all SIERRA project plugins must
                     be on :envvar:`SIERRA_PLUGIN_PATH`, or SIERRA won't be able
                     to find them.

      .. IMPORTANT:: You can't share projects across :term:`Platforms
                     <Platform>`, so if you want to be able to use your project
                     on ROS and ARGoS (for example), you will need to create 2
                     separate projects with shared python code imported into
                     each as needed.

      Specified via ``--project`` on the cmdline. See :ref:`ln-sierra-usage-cli` for
      documentation.

   Tick

      A timestep. In SIERRA, physics engines will perform some number of
      iterations per tick, and after that the controllers for all agents will be
      run.

   Batch Criteria

      A `variable` you wish to use with SIERRA to measure its effect on system
      behavior. A batch criteria can has a single axis (such as
      :ref:`ln-sierra-platform-argos-bc-population-size`), in which case it is
      called `univariate`, or have two axes (such as
      :ref:`ln-sierra-platform-argos-bc-population-size` and another batch
      criteria such as one defining sensor and actuator noise to apply to the
      robots), in which case it is called `bivariate`.

      Univariate batch criteria have one dimension, and so the graphs produced
      by them are (usually) linegraphs with a numerical representation of the
      range for the variable on the X axis, and some other quantity of interest
      on the Y.

      Bivariate batch criteria have two dimensions, and so the graphs produced
      by them are (usually) heatmaps with the first variable in the criteria on
      the X axis, the second on the Y, and the quantity of interest on
      the Z. Bivariate batch criteria are always built using univariate batch
      criteria as building blocks.

      The axis/axes you select as part of the batch criteria you will use to
      define for :term:`Batch Experiment` define the `search space` for your
      experiment: either a 1D or 2D array of :term:`Experiments<Experiment>`.

      Batch criteria define a `range` of sets changes for one or more elements
      in a template ``.xml`` file (passed to SIERRA with
      ``--template-input-file``). For each element in the range, the changes are
      applied to the template ``.xml`` file to define
      :term:`Experiments<Experiment>`. The set of defined experiments is called
      a :term:`Batch Experiment`.

      The batch criteria you can use depends on:

         - The :term:`Project` you have loaded, as each project can define their
           own batch criteria (see :ref:`ln-sierra-tutorials-project-new-bc`).

         - The :term:`Platform` you have selected, as each platform defines some
           basic batch criteria that any project/experiment can use.

      SIERRA itself does not define any batch criteria.


   Batch Experiment

      A set of :term:`Experiments<Experiment>` each defined by XML changes
      generated by the selected :term:`Batch Criteria` to a template ``.argos``
      file passed to SIERRA during stage 1 via ``--template-input-file``.

      For example, for the :ref:`ln-sierra-platform-argos-bc-population-size`
      batch criteria, each experiment is defined by a single XML change to the
      provided ``.argos`` file: the number of robots in the swarm. Depending on
      the specifics you set for the `range` of sizes you are interested in,
      several experiments will be generated from the template ``.argos`` file,
      each differing from the template in the configured swarm size.

   Experiment

      A single datapoint within a :term:`Batch Experiment`;
      that is a single value of the `thing` that you are interested in varying
      across some range of experiments to see what happens (or doesn't happen).

   Experimental Run

      Meaning is :term:`Platform` dependent.

      For ``--platform=platform.argos`` it is an :term:`ARGoS` simulation that
      runs as part of an experiment. For ``--platform=platform.ros1gazebo`` it
      is a :term:`Gazebo` simulation that runs as part of an experiment.

      The number of simulations which will be run by SIERRA in stage 2 and
      averaged together by SIERRA in stage 3 is controlled by ``--n-runs``.

      All runs in within an :term:`Experiment` are identical, with the exception
      of:

      - Different values for the XML changes resulting from the different
        experiments they are part of, as defined by the batch criteria
        generating the batch experiment.

      - Different random seeds

   Output .csv

      A CSV file generated as an output from a single :term:`Experimental
      Run`. It will (probably) contain a set of columns of representing outputs
      of interest, with rows corresponding to values captured throughout the
      run.

   Averaged .csv

      A CSV file generated as from averaging files from multiple
      :term:`Experimental Runs<Experimental Run>`. It will (probably) contain a
      set of columns of representing outputs of interest, with rows
      corresponding to values captured throughout the run (i.e., a time
      series).

   Collated .csv

      A CSV file created by SIERRA during stage 4 (if inter-experiment
      graph generation is to be run). Collated CSV files contain a set
      columns, one per :term:`Experiment` in the :term:`Batch Experiment`. Each
      column is the captured value of a `single` column within an :term:`Output
      .csv`. This is to capture a specific aspect of the behavior of the swarm
      within a batch experiment, for use in graph generation.

   Summary .csv

      A CSV file created by SIERRA during stage 4 (if inter-experiment
      graph generation is to be run). A summary CSV file created from a
      :term:`Collated .csv` file by taking the last row; this usually
      corresponds to steady-state behavior, which is what you are
      after. However, you can also capture transient behaviors by creating
      :term:`Collated .csv` and :term:`Summary .csv` files from captured
      :term:`Experimental Run` outputs over short stretches of time--SIERRA does
      not know the difference.

   Inter-Batch .csv

      A CSV file created by SIERRA during stage 5. An inter-batch CSV
      is created by "collating" columns from a :term:`Summary .csv` present in
      multiple :term:`Batch Experiments <Batch Experiment>` into a single
      CSV. Used during stage 5.

   Imagizing

      The process of turning a text file of some kind (e.g., CSV, ``.gml``)
      into an image.

   Platform

      The `context` in which experiments are run: either via a simulator of some
      kind, or a run-time framework for deploying code to one or more real
      robots.

      .. IMPORTANT:: In SIERRA terminology, platform != OS. A given OS such has
                     linux might support multiple platforms like ARGoS, ROS,
                     etc, while a different OS like OSX might support only
                     ARGoS.

   Graph Category

      A semantic label attached to a set of graphs which are similar. For
      example, if you want to generate graphs about the different ways that
      robots allocate tasks, you might create a ``LN_task_alloc`` label, so that
      you can enable/disable all task allocation related graphs for one or more
      controllers easily when :doc:`configuring
      </src/tutorials/project/graphs_config>` your project.

   Controller Category

      A semantic label attached to a set of controllers which are similar in
      some way. For example, if you have two controllers which use the same type
      of memory (say it's a "last N objects seen" memory), you could create a
      ``LastN`` category, and then define controllers within it, e.g.,
      ``LastN.Ring`` and ``LastN.DecayRing`` for two controllers which have a
      ringbuffer of remembered objects and a decaying ringbuffer of remembered
      objects (i.e., an object is forgotten after some period of time even if it
      is not forced out of the ringbuffer by seeing a new object). See
      :ref:`configuring <ln-sierra-tutorials-project-main-config>` your project.

   Model

      A python implementation of a theoretical model of some kind. Can use
      empirical data from simulations/real robot experiments, or not, as
      needed. Intended to generate predictions of `something` which can then be
      plotted against empirical results for comparison.

   Plugin

      A python package/module living in a directory on
      :envvar:`SIERRA_PLUGIN_PATH` which contains functionality to extend SIERRA
      without modifying its core (i.e., customization of different parts of the
      pipeline). Plugins come in several flavors, all of which are handled
      equivalently by SIERRA:

      - Pipeline plugins - Plugins which provide different ways of executing
        core parts of the SIERRA pipeline (e.g., how to run experiments).

      - Platform plugins - Plugins which correspond to different
        :term:`Platforms <Platform>`.

      - Project  plugins - Plugins which correspond to different
        :term:`Projects <Project>`.
