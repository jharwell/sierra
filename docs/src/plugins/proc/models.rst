============
Model Runner
============


Usage
=====

This plugin can be selected by adding ``proc.modelrunner`` to the list passed to
``--proc``. When active, this plugin will create ``<batchroot>/models``, and
data generated by all executed models stage 3 will accrue under this root
directory. Each experiment will get their own directory in this root for their
models. E.g.::

  |-- <batchroot>
      |-- models
          |-- c1-exp0
          |-- c1-exp1
          |-- c1-exp2
          |-- c1-exp3
          |-- collated

``collated/`` contains models which are generated across experiments in the
batch from :term:`Collated Output Data` files.
