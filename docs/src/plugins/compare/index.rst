==================
Comparison Plugins
==================

SIERRA supports a number of :term:`comparators <Comparator>`, all of which can
be used to compare products/deliverables generated in stage 4 in some way.

Before reading this page, take a look at :ref:`exp/design`, which details how
SIERRA experiments are architected at a high-level; these plugins tie in heavily
to that architecture.
