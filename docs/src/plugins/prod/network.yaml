  # The filepath of the source data file relative to the output directory for an

  - src_stem: 'somesubdir/foo'

    # The filepath of the graph to be generated (extension/image type is
    # determined elsewhere). This allows for multiple graphs to be generated
    # from the same data file by plotting different combinations of columns.
    dest_stem: 'bar'

    # The title the graph should have. LaTeX syntax is supported (uses
    # matplotlib after all). Optional. Defaults to '' if omitted.
    title: 'My Title'

    # The type of graph. Must be 'network'.
    type: 'network'

    # The networkx layout to use for the graph. Valid values are:
    #
    # - spring
    # - spectral
    # - planar
    # - spiral
    # - graphviz_neato

    node_color_attr: 'color'

    # omitted, all nodes will be sized according to their degree relative to the

    # The name of the GraphML edge attribute to use to color edges. If omitted,
    # all nodes will be black.

    # The name of the GraphML edge attribute to use to weight edge thickness. If
    # omitted, all nodes will be the same thickness.
