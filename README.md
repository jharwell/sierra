Python/GNU Parallel framework for running large numbers of ARGoS simulations
in parallel on Minnesota Supercomuting Institute (MSI). Also can run on
non-MSI machines for testing.

It is named thusly because it will save you a LITERAL, (not figurative) mountain
of work.

Docs are [here](https://sierra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the're so shiny!
