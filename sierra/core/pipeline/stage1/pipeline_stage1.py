           "template" XML file for each experiment which are non-:term:`Batch
           Criteria` related (e.g., :term:`Platform` changes). These changes
           apply to all experiment runs in an experiment, but may differ across
           experimental runs (e.g., # cores used for a simulator platform).

           the experiment, according to platform and :term:`Project`
           configuration.

           the filesystem after generation.
