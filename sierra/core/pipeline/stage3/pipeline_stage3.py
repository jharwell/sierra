    single :term:`Experiment` and across multiple experiments together.

    Currently this includes:

    - Generating statistics from results for generating per-experiment graphs
      during stage 4. This can generated :term:`Averaged .csv` files, among
      other statistics.

    - Collating results across experiments for generating inter-experiment
      graphs during stage 4.

    - Generating image files from project metric collection for later use in
      video rendering in stage 4.
